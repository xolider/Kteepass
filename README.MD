# Kteepass (WIP)

Kteepass is a new library written in Kotlin for manipulating KDBX files. The goal of this library is to add full support of KDBX file

out-of-the-box like loading databases from FTP, HTTP, WebDAV or Cloud providers.

The currently available features are:

## Multiplatform

Kteepass uses Kotlin Multiplatform plugin to write a single codebase and making it accessible for most platform as possible. 
Currently, it only supports Java/JVM and Android. More platforms will be added once the library becomes stable.

### Currently supported platforms:

- [x] Android
